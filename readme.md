# MAGMA

[MAGMA](https://magma-website.vercel.app/) has been recreated for the essence of next-gen animated website and thus cloned from [This is Magma](https://thisismagma.com).

## Technologies Used
HTML,

CSS,

JAVASCRIPT,

GSAP,

CANVAS.

## Objective

The primary goal was to faithfully replicate the design and functionality of the Magma website. I meticulously crafted the layout, styles, and interactive elements to match the original, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Credits

I want to credit the developers of original Magma website for inspiring this project and I'm excited to share my work with you. Further references are taken from Youtube.


## Disclaimer

This website is not optimized for mobile devices or smaller screens, in other words it has not been made responsive. It is best viewed on desktop or larger screens for the optimal user experience. And also it is a static website, thus only worked upon its frontend.
